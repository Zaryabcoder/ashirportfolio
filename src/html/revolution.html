                                My last employer worked in the domain of telecom.
                                I worked with them for just over a year where I got my
                                hands dirty with the very niche field of telecom processes
                                management and automation software. Revolution was one of
                                the softwares I worked on. It aimed at automating and
                                digitalizing the manual process of conducting and managing
                                drive test surveys.

                                Network service providers spend millions of dollars,
                                hundreds of dedicated resources and incur huge costs in
                                order to survey their network reception in a specific area.
                                They buy very expensive equipment and have to hire many
                                resources, train them, and set up a whole process on ground
                                in order to gather data and KPIs to help improve their network.

                                Why not just make a mobile application that lets anyone travelling,

                                through their phones, in return of paid incentives? It would let
                                telcos save millions in costs, resources and inventory to do so.

                                Since I was absolutely new to the field of telecom,
                                I first had to go through a lot of manuals and crash courses
                                to get an idea of how telcos operate and provide their services.
                                I had some experienced telecom engineers at my work that explained
                                me the dynamics, job roles, processes, technicalities, and
                                problems of such an organization. The research helped my get
                                familiar with the technical aspects of such a process that
                                helped me come up with a better solution to the problem at hand.

                                We identified two types of users for the solution:

                                the web based application to create drive test jobs, or "streams"
                                in technical terms and manages them.<br><br>The other type of user

                                To get started, and to keep an already complex solution simple,
                                we identified the other types of telco employees to be the early
                                adopters of this solution. We put the financial reward module at

                                    After identifying user requirements, I worked on coming up with
                                    a suitable and user centric information architecture of both the
                                    web and mobile interfaces. For this phase, I used the knowledge
                                    gained through my research into the drive test survey process,
                                    conformed with the technical jargon in order to make it as
                                    streamlined for the web app users as possible. <span style="font-weight: bold">
                                        At the same time,
                                        I had to keep the process as simple for the commuter as possible,
                                        which was a challenge.</span> After all this, we came up with web and
                                    mobile app wireframes for the telco vendor employee and
                                    commuter respectively.

                                    <span style="font-weight: bold">Challenge:</span><br>
                                    I did not know a lot about the dynamics of the telecom industry,
                                    especially when it comes to the technical aspects, jargon,
                                    specific protocols and processes. Translating the complexity
                                    on one user's side into a simple interface for the other user
                                    type. There are two types of interfaces based on the user types.
                                    The telecom manager has a web based management module, whereas
                                    the commuter has a mobile app through which they conduct the
                                    jobs.

                                    I put at least two weeks getting myself familiarized with the niche field.
                                    I talked to telecom professionals, read manuals and especially the process
                                    I was tasked to "revolutionize". The research helped a lot with the task.
                                    The process included applying a design thinking based approach,
                                    translating requirements to simple use cases and prioritizing
                                    functionalities for the commuter. I targeted the top most use cases
                                    and hence hid the complexities from the commuter.
